### Inheritance Review

We talked about initial configurations, 
and decided a good way to represent this is 
with initial positions of the minority state.

I want to include both a random XML config and predefined XML config
for testing and game of life.

We were talking about how inheritance isn't really possible
with an XML file (text files can't be inherited, only Java classes).
