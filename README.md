* Java documentation


### Running the Program

Main class: SimulatorMain

Data files needed: 
* Schema files to generate new config files
* Config files generated from schema files

Interesting data files:

Features implemented:
* Different cell shapes
* Toroidal edges
* Sliders to configure input parameters
* Configurable neighbor selection
* Initial grid configuration can be set using:
    * states at specific coordinates
    * percentages of the grid that each state occupies
    * number of cells in the grid that each state occupies
* Additional Rock Paper Scissors simulation
* Error checking for incorrect config file data
* Toggling outlines of grids

Assumptions or Simplifications:
* Grid has same height and width

Known Bugs:
*

Extra credit:
* Fun colors
